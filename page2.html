    		<h2>About Me</h2>
    		<p>I am a burgeoning .NET developer and am currently studying programming and web design at 1150 Academy in Carmel, Indiana. I have a proficiency in html, CSS, javaScript, and C# with many more languages well on the way. Before I began work in programming I was studied at Miami University where I moved through several majors including Economics and Social Studies Education before I settled on History. However I could never shake my love for technology and teaching and that took form within my minor in Educational Game Design. I have built both video and board games that achieved the goal of stimulating the learner while making the learning fun and deeply infused within the game and its mechanics. This has aided my work in web design since I have a abckground in creating easy to understand interfaces and layouts for any age group. </p>
